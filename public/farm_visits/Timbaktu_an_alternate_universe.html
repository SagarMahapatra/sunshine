Initiatives:</p> <ol><li>Swashakti for women - promotes independent, sustainable and viable alternative economic institutions of women that lead to their financial independence by creating alternative banking and co-operatives for women. (thanks to AP-MACs act)</li> <li>Dharani - Organic Farming &amp; marketing. Where they havent stoped at converting farmers into organic-farming pioneers but have made it possible and viable by providing them a market place which yields them some value for the efforts they have put in. They have done so by removing the middle-man and regulate the crop rates and bonus in such a way that different crops are grown based on season and nutrition rather than the market-price.</li> <li>Kalpavalli Eco-restoration programme - regeneration of degraded eco-system - land, water and forest. This again is possible only with the support of the locals and the end result is commendable considering how dry the entire region is! They were able to move up from 20 species to 400 species.</li> <li>Chiguru - they realize the importance of educating the next generation and thats what all the 3 programmes under this initiative are:
<ol><li>Nature School for middle age</li> <li>CRC - Children Resource Center for all children in the comminty</li> <li>Mogga - a cader run programme for children between 12-14 where they try to revive the dying-culture,  introduce the young minds the power of community and prepare them to make wise choices for their future.</li> <li>other programs on ecological conservation &amp; awareness by camping at Kalpavalli</li> <li>Future initiatives - school on permaculture for the teens with a fellowship.</li></ol></li> <li>Militha - co-operative for disabled.
<ol><li>Pratibha - which connects the aids, resources and the disabled.</li></ol></li> <li>Weaving Unit - hand woven handlooms  run by women.</li> <li>Soap Unit - hand made soaps by the disabled.</li></ol> <p>Bablu‚Äôs (Founder) talk:</p> <ol><li>Its very important to create a ‚ÄúSocial Capital‚Äù by gaining trust, knowing the ethos and pathos of the region, identifying what makes people tick. Need to connect to the place.</li> <li>The land must be 30% Forest, 30% Water &amp; 30% agriculture. there must be atleast 70-80% water around.</li> <li>Tamarind tree is like green gold</li> <li>Bundts and composting brings back moisture in the soil. Just jeevamrit is not enough for dry lands. 2-3 cows is essential. Vermi-composting is also not so bad.</li> <li>Bio-dynamics is a good alternative for panchanga as the seasons are changing. See if you can attend one of the trainings.</li> <li>Planning a good water drainage is very cruicial and one of the most important steps - identifying ways to slow down the water flow.</li> <li>Groundnuts MUST be rain-fed.</li> <li>1 kg rice needs around 15K ltrs of water.</li> <li>Mono-cropping is vary harmful. It was the primary cause for the famine in Euthopia</li> <li>Ideally in 1 acre - 6 to 14 diff types of crops can be grown esp navadhanyas (millets, pulses, oil seeds</li> <li>Sand has calcium so use it wisely, dry soils with a lot of rocks are already rich in calcium.</li> <li>promote pulses, millets and groundnuts.</li> <li>Harlikar cow - the best breed, very strong cows (they were used for pulling cannons)
<ol><li>can be used for ploughing</li> <li>milk only about 3-4 liters but its the best milk with high nutrition content, high fat &amp; low water content. Used in making aurvedic medicine, pure ghee</li> <li>They are drought-resistant, adapted to have long legs which help them climb to higher altitudes for green. Also not fussy about the grass.</li></ol></li> <li>Dharani took 6 years to break-even. Still not doing profits..
<ol><li>52% of MRP must go to farmers only then will their earning % go up.</li> <li>PGS certificate within community. Very important to get Organic Certification.</li></ol></li> <li>Grow kanuga and caster for oil with medicinal value.</li> <li>‚ÄúManagement of land is an art‚Äù its a knowlege developed over centuries of experience. The locals/farmers have it in them so take their advice.</li> <li>Unfortunately ‚ÄúTrue Cost Accounting‚Äù is not practiced in India.</li> <li>Every Cooperative ‚Üí Sanghas of 15 people ‚Üí with 3 brunda‚Äôs of 5 people each.</li> <li>Some book suggestions:
<ol><li>Bill Morrison‚Äôs book on Permaculture</li> <li>The economy of permanance by Kumarappa</li> <li>Roots by Alex Haley</li></ol></li> <li>Personal discussion:
<ol><li>a few places to visit:
<ol><li>Gandhi-gram</li> <li>Tribal Health initiative in Tamil Nadu (Seethalinga)</li> <li>Kailasham Farms</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol> <h2 id="organic-farming-techniques"><a href="#organic-farming-techniques" class="header-anchor">#</a> Organic Farming techniques:</h2> <ol><li>Goat penning - arrange a sleep-over for goats in the land you plan to cultivate for atleast 15 days. https://indianwildlifeclub.com/ezine/view/details.aspx?aid=1138</li> <li>then lightly plough with ox (no tractors)</li> <li>sow in the seeds with jeevamrit or if sowing saplings dip the roots in jeevamrit like kashaya before planting.</li> <li>After the crop starts sprouting to about 1 inch (approx 15 days) spray neem-kashaya (neem oil + neem seeds crushed and soaked for a day, dilute with water) 1 acre needs about 100 litres. This is NOT pest-control its to make the crop pet-resistant.</li> <li>Other kashaya‚Äôs for plant growth at around 40 days - panchapatra kashaya / panchagavya / dashapatra kashaya.</li> <li>Growth enhancers needs to be applied twice for a crop, once on flowering and once the grain has developed.</li> <li>Try GPP (bio dynamics) observed to be very effective and they are also still experimenting to adapt - https://www.biodynamics.in/cow-pat-pit</li> <li>Keep a halikar cow and have urine pits to collect urine from the night.</li></ol> <p>Other numbers:</p> <ol><li>Seeds needed differs for each crop. For Raagi you need 10 Kgs for 1 acre where as other millets need about 3 kgs for 1 acre.</li> <li>4 kgs of prosso millet leads to 8 quintals of produce and is the quickest millet - 70 day crop.</li> <li>some farmers are selling panchagavya for rs.80 / litre to other farmers.</li> <li>1 acre needs 3 liters of panchagavya and must be applied about twice.</li> <li>Millet pricing set by Timbaktu for farmers:
