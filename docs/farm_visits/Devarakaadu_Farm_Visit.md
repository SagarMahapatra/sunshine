## Primary purpose of visit (for us): 

Understanding mud house building


## Main Concept:
1. Natural farming to the extent possible - starting from no dry waste like fallen coconut leaves or cut trees or dry leaves ever leaves the farm, going upto she wouldnt even harvest the coconuts only picks them when they dry and fall off.
2. Minimum investment - she feels keeping cattle like cow could also be expensive for very little gain instead gets the cow-dung etc from her helper-farmer’s own cattle to make jeeva-amrit.
3. Runs an NGO PranaPoorna - where sustainable living has been made a reality by creating enzymes from citric peels, jaggery, yeast and water. More details - https://naturalcleaners.weebly.com/
4. Preserve the concept of SacredGroves aka Devarakaadu in kannada - wherein villages used to keep a piece of land dedicated to grow medicinal & holy trees.
5. Do not leave the land clean and barren, in other words dont de-weed.
6. Increase the land-water
7. A space where she can make people connect to the inner self more easily - Self-awareness workshops

**Zoning:**

1. Free space with devarakadu on one side
2. Mud house and toilet-pits
3. Fruiting tree & well on one side
4. Banana grove & medicinal/essential oil plants
5. avarekai & seasonal crops
6. Cotton & caster at the boundaries

@sagar m - lets attach a zone sketch here.


**Growing tips:**

1. Cover the root of the plant/tree with a lot of coconut-shells/dry leaves which will attract termites and inter other insects which will help keep the moisture intact near the roots.
2. Plan the lay outing aka where to plant which tree well:
  1. Plant the trees with a yearly yield across the boundaries as they would need lesser maintenance
  2. Plant the other trees with frequent yield closer/inwards to monitor and care better. 
  3. Keep the trees with a lot of shade at the periphery
3. North East is devara mula (vastu)
4. Plant fruit saplings in April & May (GKVK)
5. Fish remains are great amino acid source just 2% dilution needed
